# CraftPorjectLearn
This project record the process to learn open craft project,detail information in readme :)

You can find the project url:https://github.com/fogleman/Craft.git which I will continue to learn and share my experience!

Here ,the main way I used to learn an unknown project is use git to trace its commits,learn the project from 0 to 1!
also,I will  simulate the author's implementation processÔºÅ
