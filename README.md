# CraftPorjectLearn
This project record the process to learn open craft project,detail information in readme :)

You can find the project url:https://github.com/fogleman/Craft.git which I will continue to learn and share my experience!

Here ,the main way I used to learn an unknown project is use git to trace its commits,learn the project from 0 to 1!
also,I will  simulate the author's implementation processÔºÅ

I use the SHA1 ID to mark fogleman's Craft project for you can easily use git to find it.
Then I will demenstrate some changes happened in the commit,since fogleman's commit start in 2013,lots of things have already changed.

1.commit e3fd09b13f3e134fe76c679902503d76484d86c1

This is the first commit that fogleman upload to his github.

He used glfw version2 in 2013,Now this already changed to 3,so if you want to re-accomplish his first commit,you should download version2.

So in case that you don't want to find them,I put the file in (glew-2.1.0-win32 directory and glfw-legacy-master directory)

I use minGW on Windows to compile it,the concrete use for minGW in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532234/how-to-run-a-makefile-in-windows.

In the powershell use "choco install make " to make Makefile.

Download the mingw-get and follow the instructions it will automatically download the basic lib we need.
